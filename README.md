# Visualization Challenge

In this task I assume the role of a Senior Data Analyst for a startup pharmaceutical company called Pymaceuticals, Inc., who specialise in cancer treatments. They have recently began screening and testing for squamous cell carcinoma in a new study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The following were the tasks I needed to complete:
1. Generate summary statistics for the entire trial, containing all the drugs used, with the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume
2. Create bar charts showing the number of measured timepoints for each drug regimen, one is to be made using pandas, and one with pyplot
3. Create pie charts showing the number of male and female mice in this study, one is to be made using pandas, and one with pyplot
4. Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Then, calculate the quartiles and IQR, and determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens
5. Making a boxplot showing the final tumor volume for all the mice in each treatment group using matplotlib
6. Create a line plot for a single mouse treated with Capomulin measuring tumor volume over time
7. Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen
8. Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen
9. Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot
