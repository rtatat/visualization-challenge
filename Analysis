In the original 249 mice dataset, it was found that the entry for the mouse designated g989 had duplicate 
timepoint entries.
Following the removal of g989, the 248 mice dataset was analysed.
Analysing the summary statistics, it can be found that Capomulin and Ramicane exhibit similar outputs,
especially when compared to the performance of all of the other drugs, which all perform relatively similarly.
Both Capomulin and Propriva were measured significantly more than the other regimens, which can result in a bias.
The proportion of mice genders was almost 50/50.
Out of the four most promising drug treatments (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin), it can be seen that
Capomulin and Ramicane are the best performing, with Ramicane performing slightly better than Capomulin.
When singling out the mouse designated r554, which was treated with Capomulin, it can be observed that
Capomulin resulted in a very sharp decline in tumor volume following the 3rd or 4th timepoint. Along the course of
the study, r554 exhibited a continual reduction in tumor volume, eventually appearing to plateau
at approximately 32.5 mm3 in volume. This appears to suggest a limitation in Capomulin's effectiveness.
The correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume is 0.84, which indicates a positive relationship between
the two.
